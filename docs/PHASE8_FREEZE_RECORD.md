# PHASE 8 FREEZE RECORD
**Decision Accountability Documentation System (DADS)**  
**Phase:** 8 (Planning)  
**Status:** Complete and Locked  
**Freeze Rule:** Append-only; supersession required for changes

## Scope Locked
The following Phase 8 planning documents are complete and locked:

- PHASE8_A_INSTITUTIONAL_INTERACTION_MODEL.md
- PHASE8_B_MISUSE_AND_CAPTURE_RESISTANCE.md
- PHASE8_C_ADOPTION_WITHOUT_OWNERSHIP.md
- PHASE8_D_EVIDENTIARY_LIFECYCLE.md

## Assertions
- Phase 8 introduced no enforcement, compliance scoring, approvals, identity systems, or authority surfaces.
- Phase 8 is planning-only: no new runtime requirements, no new validators beyond prior phases, and no change to core DADS boundaries.
- Any future work that alters Phase 8 meaning must be done via explicit supersession records/documents, not edits.

## Review Posture
Phase 8 planning exists to preserve DADS integrity under institutional contact:
- DADS remains ownerless by design
- DADS remains zero-trust compatible
- DADS remains evidentiary-grade without claiming correctness or legality

## Change Control
- This freeze record is the authoritative boundary for Phase 8.
- Amendments require a new freeze supersession document (do not edit this file).
