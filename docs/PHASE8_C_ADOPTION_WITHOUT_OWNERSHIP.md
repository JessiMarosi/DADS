# Phase 8-C  Adoption Without Ownership
**Decision Accountability Documentation System (DADS)**  
**Status:** Draft (Planning Only)

## 1. Core Problem
If DADS is useful, institutions will attempt to:
- standardize it
- own it
- certify it
- mandate it

Every one of these actions would corrupt it.

## 2. Acceptable Adoption Forms

**Reference Adoption**
- Citing language or concepts
- No claims of endorsement

**Clone-and-Run Adoption**
- Forking and using internally
- No canonical status implied

**Academic Adoption**
- Critique, analysis, extension
- No speaking on behalf of DADS

## 3. What DADS Will Never Provide
- certification marks
- official registries
- trust seals
- compliance mappings
- canonical hosts

Ownership is made useless by design.

## 4. Forking Is Expected
Forks that add:
- enforcement
- authority
- interpretation

are no longer DADS  and that is acceptable.

## 5. Conclusion
DADS remains free by refusing to be valuable as a possession.
