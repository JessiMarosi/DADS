# Stabilized Invariants & Locks

These invariants are binding for DADS.

---

## A. Execution Discipline (Authoritative)

All DADS planning, build, and maintenance actions must follow the Bytelock execution discipline.

No step may proceed unless all of the following are explicitly defined and recorded:

- WHY the step exists
- WHERE the step occurs
- HOW the step is executed
- WHAT TO EXPECT as a deterministic outcome
- IF IT FAILS, the corrective action without guesswork

This rule applies to:
- documentation
- repository changes
- tooling
- validation
- reporting
- integration
- maintenance

Steps that do not meet this standard are invalid.

---

## B. Governance-Configurable Visibility

Visibility of DADS records is configurable by the organization's governance authority.  
Record immutability is absolute regardless of visibility.

---

## C. Court-Admissibility Posture

DADS records are:
- contemporaneous
- immutable
- attributable to a specific human principal
- independently verifiable without reliance on oral testimony

---

## D. Silence-As-Record

The absence of a declaration or acknowledgment is itself a recordable state.

---

## E. Non-Inference / No Legal Responsibility

DADS records facts and declared context only.  
Intent, negligence, legality, and compliance determinations are external to DADS.

---

## F. Export Integrity

Exported reports must be verifiably traceable to their source records and provably unaltered from the time of export.

---

## G. No AI Reliance

DADS does not rely on AI for interpretation, judgment, or record generation.

---

## H. Infrastructure-Grade Security Posture

DADS is designed for infrastructure-grade environments.  
Security guarantees prioritize integrity, availability, and non-repudiation over convenience.
