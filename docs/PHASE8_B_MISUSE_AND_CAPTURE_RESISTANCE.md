# Phase 8-B  Misuse & Capture Resistance
**Decision Accountability Documentation System (DADS)**  
**Status:** Draft (Planning Only)

## 1. Purpose
This document identifies how DADS can be misused, diluted, or captured **without malicious intent**.

Misuse  malice.  
Most risk comes from convenience and institutional inertia.

## 2. Primary Misuse Vectors

**Compliance Laundering**  
Using DADS as evidence of compliance rather than accountability.

**Rubber-Stamp Governance**  
Treating validator PASS as approval.

**Retroactive Narrative Construction**  
Writing records after outcomes are known.

**Institutional Capture**  
Redefining DADS as a product, framework, or mandate.

**Weaponized Documentation**  
Using records selectively to punish individuals or shield leadership.

## 3. Why These Cannot Be Fixed
Adding controls would:
- centralize authority
- encourage compliance theater
- shift responsibility to tooling

All of which would destroy DADS.

## 4. Resistance Strategy
DADS resists misuse by:
- refusing enforcement
- refusing interpretation
- refusing optimization for optics
- refusing authority

## 5. Acceptable Failures
- DADS may be ignored
- DADS may be misused socially
- DADS may be forked irresponsibly

These are **human failures**, not system failures.

## 6. Conclusion
> The greatest threat to DADS is success without discipline.

If DADS becomes mandatory, certified, or enforced  it has already failed.
