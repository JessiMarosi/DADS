# Product Constitution (Non-Negotiables)

DADS will never:

- Generate or fabricate rationale. Human accountability is mandatory.
- Allow history to be rewritten. Records are append-only; supersession requires explanation.
- Optimize optics over truth. Unknowns remain visible.
- Centralize untraceable authority. Every decision has a named human owner.
- Operate as surveillance. Systems and decisions only  not people.
- Be a black box. All links must be explainable.
- Disappear at moments of risk. High-impact changes require recorded accountability.

DADS does not certify correctness  only accountability and truthfulness of record.

DADS records must be sufficient for a qualified successor to resume stewardship without oral history.
