# Phase 8-A  Institutional Interaction Model
**Decision Accountability Documentation System (DADS)**  
**Status:** Draft (Planning Only)

## 1. Purpose
This document defines how institutions interact with DADS **without owning, operating, or delegating authority to it**.

It answers one question only:

> Where does DADS stop, and where does institutional authority begin?

## 2. Non-Negotiable Principle
DADS never replaces institutional authority.

It does not:
- approve decisions
- certify compliance
- enforce policy
- interpret legality
- adjudicate disputes

DADS only records **accountable truth as written by humans**.

## 3. Interaction Layers
Institutions interact with DADS only through:
1. Read-only evidence consumption
2. Human-authored record contribution
3. Procedural reference
4. Adversarial scrutiny

There is **no operator role**.

## 4. Institutional Actor Boundaries

**Auditors**
- May read bundles, verify hashes, trace lineage
- May not treat validation output as approval

**Regulators**
- May examine records as evidence
- May not delegate compliance determination

**Legal Counsel**
- May use records to establish knowledge state
- May not treat tooling as legal opinion

**Courts**
- May admit records as evidence
- May not treat DADS as an expert witness

**Program Offices**
- May author records
- May not use DADS to approve decisions

**Investigators / IG**
- May examine timelines and attribution
- May not infer intent or guilt from absence

## 5. Disallowed Interaction Patterns
- DADS approved this
- DADS says we were compliant
- The system made the decision
- Validation equals permission

These statements are structurally false.

## 6. Zero-Trust Alignment
DADS assumes:
- reviewers may be adversarial
- context may be incomplete
- records may be selectively presented

Therefore:
- everything is reproducible
- nothing is authoritative
- verification never implies trust

## 7. Conclusion
DADS is designed to be **used by institutions without belonging to them**.  
Any phase that violates this boundary must be rejected.
