# Evidentiary Guarantees

DADS is designed to preserve institutional truth under investigation, litigation, and historical scrutiny.

This document defines the evidentiary posture of all DADS records.

---

## A. Contemporaneity

DADS records are created at the time a decision, declaration, or acknowledgment occurs.

Records are not reconstructed after the fact and do not rely on later recollection or oral testimony.

---

## B. Immutability

All DADS records are append-only in intent.

Existing records are never edited or deleted.
Changes in understanding or direction are captured through explicit supersession records.

This prevents narrative rewriting and post-incident alteration.

---

## C. Attribution

Every DADS record is attributable to a specific human principal.

Attribution includes:
- the individual responsible
- role context at the time of record creation
- creation timestamp

Shared or anonymous authorship is not permitted.

---

## D. Verifiability

DADS records are designed to be independently verifiable.

An external reviewer must be able to evaluate:
- record authenticity
- record integrity
- record lineage

Verification must not rely on oral explanation by system operators.

---

## E. Derived Notices (Advisory Only)

DADS may generate derived notice records when a decision intersects a declared obligation domain.

Derived notices:
- do not determine legality or compliance
- do not imply intent or negligence
- preserve only that a notice condition existed at decision time

They exist solely to preserve evidence of awareness, not to enforce behavior.

---

## F. Silence as Evidence

The absence of a declaration, acknowledgment, or rationale is itself a recordable state.

DADS preserves this absence to prevent later claims of implicit compliance or assumed review.

---

## G. Export Integrity

All exported reports are derived views of immutable source records.

Exports must be:
- traceable to their source records
- provably unaltered from the time of export
- suitable for submission as evidence without editorial modification

---

## H. Boundary of Responsibility

DADS does not render legal judgments, certify compliance, or assign fault.

Legal conclusions, intent determination, and liability assessment are external to DADS.

DADS preserves facts and declared context only.
