# Decision Accountability Documentation System (DADS)

**Status:** Phase 2.2 complete and locked

---

## What DADS Is

The **Decision Accountability Documentation System (DADS)** is governance-grade documentation infrastructure designed to preserve **institutional truth**.

DADS exists to make system decisions, rationale, known risks, and human accountability **durable across time, personnel change, audits, litigation, and scrutiny**  without enforcing behavior, rewriting history, or automating judgment.

DADS answers, credibly and immutably:

- Why does this system exist the way it does?
- Who made or approved this decision?
- What risks were knowingly accepted, and by whom?
- What was known at the time the decision was made?

---

## What DADS Is Not

DADS does **not**:

- Prevent cyberattacks  
- Enforce compliance  
- Certify correctness or legality  
- Monitor people or productivity  
- Generate or fabricate rationale  
- Rewrite or delete history  
- Act as a black-box authority  
- Use AI for interpretation, judgment, or record generation  

**Critical boundary:**  
DADS does not certify correctness  only accountability and truthfulness of record.

## Core Governance Rule

**Append-Only Truth Rule**

- Records are never edited to change meaning  
- Corrections require new records with explicit supersession  
- Original records remain visible permanently

- **Phase 1.5  Minimal Validator** (Complete, Locked)  
- **Phase 2  Architecture & Lifecycle** (Complete, Locked)  
- **Phase 2.1  Threat Model** (Complete, Locked)  
- **Phase 2.2  Failure Modes & Misuse Analysis** (Complete, Locked)

## Evidentiary Posture

DADS records are designed to be:

- Contemporaneous  
- Immutable  
- Attributable  
- Independently verifiable  
- Intelligible without oral testimony  

DADS asserts only what is recorded.  
Unknowns remain unknown.

## One-Sentence Essence

**DADS preserves institutional truth by making system decisions, rationale, and human accountability durable across time, people, and scrutiny.**
