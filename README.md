# DADS  Decision Accountability Documentation System

DADS is institutional truth infrastructure: a governance-grade system for preserving decision accountability, rationale, and architectural truth across time, turnover, and scrutiny.

DADS exists to answer, credibly and durably:
- Why does this system exist the way it does?
- Who made or approved this decision?
- What risks were knowingly accepted, and by whom?
- What was known at the time the decision was made?

Non-negotiable posture:
- Human accountability is mandatory (no fabricated rationale).
- History is append-only (no rewriting; supersession is explicit).
- Unknowns remain visible (no optics-over-truth).
- No surveillance (systems and decisions only, not people).
- No black-box authority (explainable links only).
- Read-only evidentiary reporting.
- No AI interpretation, judgment, or record generation.

Court posture:
DADS records are contemporaneous, immutable, attributable, and independently verifiable without reliance on oral testimony.

Status: Build planning (Phase 0 foundation in progress).
